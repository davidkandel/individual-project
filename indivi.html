<p>Nepal is a geographically diverse county and popular for mountaineering, trekking and touring as the country has some of the highest mountains in the world, including Mount Everest. The spectacular landscape of Nepal represents the potential for tourism. The country is divided into three principal geographic belts known as Himal-Pahad-Terai.

Terai is the lowland region holding some of the gorgeous green plain fields fed by the three major Himalayan Rivers: the Koshi, the Narayani, and the Karnali. The Pahad area is basically hilly region in-between Terai and Himal (mountain). The region is filled with greenery and dense forest which is home to many rare species that are only found in Nepal. And the Himal is the mountain range that covers some of the tallest mountains of the world. </br>

Considering the diversity that Nepal contains, there is no doubt that the country is the best destination for touring and trekking. While trekking is the most famous one, touring, jungle safari, rafting, zip flying, paragliding, bungee jumping in Nepal are some of the activities that one can enjoy while visiting Nepal. </p>
